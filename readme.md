## Build a Bookstore Page - step by step

In this workshop, you will build a bookstore page by creating book cards that display information about different books. You'll practice organizing content using `<div>` elements, classes, and IDs.

### Step 1

Start your bookstore page by creating the HTML boilerplate.  
Add the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration and `<html>` and `<head>` elements. Add a `lang` attribute to the `html` element and set it to `"en"`.

### Step 2

Add the `<title>` element inside the `<head>` element.
Set the page `title` to `XYZ Bookstore Page`.

### Step 3

Now, improve the structure of your HTML document to ensure your page is encoded correctly.  
Inside the `head` element, add the `<meta charset="UTF-8">` element.
Lastly, add a `<body>` element below the `head` section. This is where all of your visible page content will go.

### Step 4  

In this step, add an `h1` element with the text `XYZ Bookstore`.

### Step 5  

Below the `h1` element, add a `<p>` element with this text: `Browse our collection of amazing books!`.

### Step 6  

The `div` element is used as a container to group other HTML elements. You will mainly use the `div` element when you want to group HTML elements that will share a set of CSS styles.  
Below the `p` element, add a `div` element. This `div` will be a container for your book cards.  

**Note**: This workshop does not apply CSS. Classes and grouped elements are useful for CSS styling, but in this workshop they are used only to structure and group content. You will learn how styling works in a later module.  

### Step 7  

The `class` attribute is used to identify one or more elements for styling. Unlike the `id` attribute, class names do not need to be unique: multiple elements can share the same class.  
Here is an example:  

**Example Code**  

```<p class="example">example paragraph</p>```  

Add a `class` attribute to your `div` element and set its value to `card-container`.  

### Step 8  

You can add multiple elements inside a `div` element to group related content. Inside the element having a `class` of `card-container`, create another `div` element. This `div` will represent the first book card.  

Add a `class` attribute to this new `div` element and set the value of the `class` attribute to `card`.  

### Step 9  

The `id` attribute adds a unique identifier to an HTML element. Each `id` should be unique within a page and should only be used once.  
`id` values cannot contain spaces and should only contain letters, digits, underscores, and dashes.  
Here is an example:  

**Example Code**  

```<p id="para">example paragraph</p>```  

Add an `id` attribute to your element having a class of `card` and set its value to `sally-adventure-book`.  

### Step 10  

Inside the first element having a class of `card`, add an `h2` element with the text `Sally's SciFi Adventure`.  

### Step 11  

Below the `h2` element in the first element having a class of `card`, add a `p` element with the following text:  

**Example Code**  
```This is an epic story of Sally and her dog Rex as they navigate through other worlds.```

### Step 12  

The `button` element is used to create clickable buttons on a webpage. Buttons are interactive elements that users can click to perform actions.  

Add a `button` element inside the element that has a `class` of `card`, give the button a `class` attribute set to `btn`, and the text `Buy Now`.  

### Step 13  

Now create a second book card. Add another `div` element with the `class` attribute set to `card`. Notice how you can reuse the same class name for multiple elements to apply consistent styling.  

### Step 14  

Add an `id` attribute to your second element having a class of `card` and set its value to `dave-cooking-book`. Remember that each `id` must be unique.  

### Step 15  

Inside the second element having a class of `card`, add an `h2` element with the text `Dave's Cooking Adventure`.  

### Step 16 
 
Below the `h2` element in the second card, add a `p` element with this text:  

**Example Code**  
```This is the story of Dave as he learns to cook everything from pancakes to pasta, one recipe at a time```  

### Step 17  

Inside the second card, add a `button` element with the `class` attribute set to `btn` and the text `Buy Now`.  

Both `button` elements now share the same class, which means they can be styled consistently together.  

### Step 18  

Remember, an HTML element looks like this:  

**Example Code**  

```<element attribute="value">inner text</element>```  

Below the element with the class `card-container`, add a new `p` element with this text:  

**Example Code**  

```Review your selections and continue to checkout.```  

Below the `p` element, create a `div` element with the `class` attribute set to `btn-container`. This container will group your navigation button elements.
